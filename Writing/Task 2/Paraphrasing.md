<p><b>Tips for IELTS Background Statements</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t write a very long background statement. It doesn’t help your score to do that and wastes valuable time.</li>
<li>Try to write your background statement as one complex sentence. to do that, use a clause and correct linking.</li>
<li>Don’t paraphrase unless you are 100% sure your word is perfect. Not all words can be changed in English. Be selective when you paraphrase. Paraphrasing is a skill about when to change something and also when NOT to change something.</li>
<li>Don’t aim to impress – aim for accuracy instead.</li>
<li>You don’t always need to start your background with “some people..”. See all the options above.</li>
<li>You should not start your essay with overused expressions that are popular with low level English users, such as “In the modern era,” or “With the advent of modern technology..”</li>
<li>Avoid learning expressions which you think will impress the examiner “A hot debate..” / “a burning question..” “a highly controversial issue..”. The examiner is trained to spot these learned expressions. They don’t help your score and show a lack if individuality in your language. You need to write each sentence in your own words, unique to yourself.</li>
</ol>
