**A)** A big factor has been a fall in discretionary spending, spurred by rising shop prices and weak wage growth.&nbsp;A near 15% fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed inflation over 3% – way above the Bank of England’s 2% target. This has made imported goods more expensive, with those costs passed on to consumers.&nbsp;Couple that with the fact that wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation – and shoppers have less disposable income to spend in stores and restaurants.

**B)** Online giants such as Amazon have had a huge impact on the high street as more consumers see online shopping as cheaper and easier than going to the shops.&nbsp;And while overall retail sales growth is weak, online sales continue to shoot up.&nbsp;If shops fail to do either “value, convenience, or experience” well, they will struggle, Mr Martin says.

**C)** Toy store “Toys R Us” fell short in all three areas, according to Simon Thomas of Moorfields Advisory, the toy chain’s administrators.&nbsp;He says it was “unlikely” the retailer can be saved because its business model “isn’t what consumers really want now”.&nbsp;“We’ve got very large stores which are fairly impersonal. People are looking now to have a better shopping experience, and we were unable to deliver that.”

**D)** Inflation is not the only cost pressure retailers face. The National Minimum Wage and new National Living Wage for over-25s go up each year, pushing up payroll costs.&nbsp;“Business rates are deterring investment in local communities, causing shop closures and job losses in hard-pressed communities and preventing retailers from delivering what their customers want in an efficient and cost-effective way.”

**E)** As a consequence of over expansion, many retailers are shouldering “high debt burdens”, says KPMG’s Mr Martin.&nbsp;Just before its collapse, Toys R Us UK faced a looming VAT debt payment deadline of £15m. It would have been unable to pay it without a cash injection from an outside investor.
