## Questions
### Do you like painting or drawing? 
Drawing has always been a passion since I was a child. It was a good opportunity for me to have drawing a compulsory subject in my primary and secondary school. Although as a university student, I can’t spend hours on drawing, once I have inspiration, I would definitely manage my time to draw. Additionally, I’m not good at painting so I think drawing is fairly enough.
### How often do you visit art galleries? 
To tell you the truth, I have never visited art galleries before. Unless I have a guide to acknowledge me, art galleries would be quite boring for me.
### What kinds of things do you like to draw? 
My main inspiration are Japanese manga. The drawing topic is extremely varied, however only manga seems to show great potency for my level. I have a big collection at home and as I sometimes go through it again, I can see how much I’ve improved.
### Is it easy to learn how to draw? 
I think I must say it’s even challenging to a lot of people. I absolutely failed when it comes to drawing anything ‘real’ like people, trees and flowers. I think for those who succeed in drawing or arts in general, they first must have God-gifted taste of arts, then comes the long-term commitment that requires extreme practice and high patience.
