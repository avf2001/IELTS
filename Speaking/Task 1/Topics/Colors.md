## Questions
### What colors do you like? 
Since my taste always changes, my favorite color at the moment is black. Although I have just bought some black items recently, black surprisingly suits me. It feels like I become more mature and more mysterious when wearing a black dress. And because it’s one of the basic colors, it’s easy to mix and match with other items of different colors and styles.
### Do colors affect your mood? 
Actually, the converse effect is more suitable for me, especially when it comes to shopping. I don’t thnk I’d feel happier when I look at a pink-colored shirt or feel pulled-down when I wear a gray cardigan. So no, I don’t think color is related to my feelings inside.
