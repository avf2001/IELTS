## Questions
### Do you often read?
### What is your favourite kind of book to read?
### Do you often read newspapers?
### Do you have any e-books?
### What books did you read as a child?
### Do you think it is important to encourage children to read?
### How often do you read?
**Sample 1**  
As a final year student I spend most of my time on reading, especially textbooks and other reference books that my lecturers recommend in the reading list. I’m also a fan of novels or fictions, but only during summer break that I have time to read them.
### Do you have many books at home?
**Sample 1**  
Totally. I’m a bookaholic to be honest. I enjoy going to annual book fairs where they usually run big sales to get lots of books without much worries ‘bout the price. Since my parents are also book-nerds, I think the number of books we have is even enough to open a bookstore.
### Do Vietnamese people do enough reading?
**Sample 1**  
If you mean reading something meaningful and realistic, I must say it’s not enough. The young generation are too into technology that I don’t think they have time for reading. Plus, publishing nowadays is not as strictly selective as it used to be, thus the young mostly read a number of books which indeed have no value at all, compared to Les Miserable, Gone with the wind, Jane Eyre, etc.
### What kind of people like reading and what kind of people don’t like reading very much?
**Sample 1**  
From my point of view, I think book-nerds are those who prefer putting themselves into the character’s shoe, you know, they wanna interact with the story, the characters on their own way. Some of them love to imagine how the story is supposed to continue while some keep wondering what they would do if the drama suddenly happened in their real life. Those who do not like to read are either too busy with their life that they even can’t remember the characters’ names, or they prefer listening, I mean, they have someone read the story and tell them the ending only.
