## Questions
### What kinds of housing are there in China? 
There arc many kinds of housing just as in other countries. There arc Hats and houses and also villas, but of course most people can’t afford anything other than flats. That is at least the case in the cities. In the rural areas, there are many people who live in houses, but these are usually very simple houses and these people are usually farmers.
### How do people decide on the kind of housing they choose to live in? 
In reality I don’t think most people have a lot of choices. Unless they are very rich, and these people are few in number compared to the general population. Most decide on flats because that is all they can afford. Usually people will try to choose something as close to their workplace as possible. Unfortunately even in that there is not much choice and many people still have to spend a lot of time traveling to and from work.
### For most Chinese people, what is an ideal house? 
I think if most Chinese people could choose any house they wanted, they would choose a private individual house rather than a flat. They’d also want something with a garden where they could have flowers and trees and even grow some vegetables. They would also want something big enough that they could have members of their family live with them or at least a place they could stay if they came for a visit.
### How has housing changed in China? 
Nowadays people live in Hals and often these are in tall buildings if in big cities. In the past most lived in houses even if they were small. Some cities had courtyard houses where many family members lived together, and there was a garden in the middle where they could enjoy the outdoors together. You’ve probably heard of these. They are interesting to foreigners.
### How will housing change in the future? 
I can imagine there will be more flats in the big cities that will he in taller buildings and with more modem facilities and equipment built into them. I hope though that some designers will do something to see that there are more park areas in between the buildings. I think city planners are making a big mistake by cramming in so much concrete. More green areas would be an important change to make in the future.
