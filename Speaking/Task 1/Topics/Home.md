  > We live in a pretty spacious apartment in Nanjing. I live on the 8th floor of a high-rise, and its size about 120 square metres. It is a fairly nice place. Our apartment has six rooms - one living room, one kitchen, two bathrooms and another two bedrooms. All of them are well decorated and furnished. There is a big bookshelf beside my brother’s room so that my brother can easily get books to read. In addition, we have a big balcony outside so that we can enjoy eating dinner and having tea there.
* Which room does your family spend most of the time in? 
  > My family spend most of their time in the living room. We like to sit around on a set of comfortable sofas there and chat with each other or watch TV. But when I am free, I prefer to read alone in my room.
* Who do you live with? 
  > I live with my mum and dad and my brother. Our apartment is pretty big so there is enough space for everyone. We bought the apartment four years ago. And my brother is in the school near my home, so we won't intend to move in the future.
* Are the transport facilities to your home very good? 
  > We sometimes go out by car because it is not convenient to take a taxi in that area, and it takes nearly 30 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station. So generally speaking, it is not good to go out without a car.
* Do you live in a house or a flat? 
  > I live with my parents in our private house. Although during the time I studied abroad I already experienced living in a flat, but it ended up not so good so home sweet home, I think I’m okay with my house.
* How long have you lived there? 
  > Although during my childhood my family had to move a lot, I’ve lived in this most recent house for almost 10 years. Compare to the old houses, I think this house has been the best so far.
* Do you plan to live there for a long time? (If you answer you haven’t lived there long) 
  > The answer would be yes for my parents, since moving in and out is too time-consuming. Cleaning and arranging everything all over again would be like torture to them. Instead, as I’m thinking of moving out, hopefully soon I’ll be able to afford living in a flat or an apartment.
* What’s the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past? 
  > As I’ve already mentioned my family moved several times when I was younger. And the most current house where we’ve been living for about 10 years is the best house so far. All of us have separate rooms for our needs of privacy yet a big dining room where we can spend the whole evenings together watching TV or having dinner.
* Can you describe the place where you live?/ Please describe the room you live in/ What parts of your home do you like the most? 
  > Briefly, my humble 4-floor house locates in a small and quite street, so coming home to me is like all the craziness happened outside is left behind. Just besides my house stands a big old tree. I have my own room with walls painted violet, which was exactly my favorite color. The air outside is fresh. I usually open the window to let the wind and sunshine in, which will help cooling down my room without air conditioner. Since I spend most of my time staying at home, my room means the whole world for me .It’s like a friend who is always there to share ups and downs with me day and night. So yeah, I would always miss my house, my room whenever I’m away.
* Which room does your family spend most of the time in? 
  > It’s the dining room where we spend most time together. We are a traditional family that while having dinner we watch the news and talk about our days. Endless stories have been told so we can help each other through hard times. Also we try to keep the family dinner as something we cannot go a day without, since for us it’s the family bonding that lies behind.
* What do you usually do in your house/flat/room? 
  > Well definitely I’ll spend some me-time there. I study, I chill with my hobbies such as reading, drawing and dancing all by myself. Sometimes I also invite one or two friends to spend time with. We’ll watch some movies together and tell each other endless stories.
* Are the transport facilities to your home very good? 
  > As I’ve already mentioned, my house locates in a quite neighborhood. After taking the bus I still need to walk for about 5 minutes more to get home. And I also come home quite late at around 6 pm so the traffic is not too crazy.
