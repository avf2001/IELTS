## Questions
### Do you think people rely too much on machines nowadays? 
I think that many people rely loo greatly on machines. They seem to forget that there are people around them. It is easy to become completely absorbed in computers or phones or PDAs or MP3 players. People will more often turn to their machines for entertainment rather than spending time with others or getting exercise.
### What arc the advantages that we get from using modern home and office equipment? 
There are some advantages to using modern home and office equipment. One of the main ones is that more things get done and often we can complete projects and assignments very quickly. We are also able to do things that we wouldnâ€™t have been able to do before, like working at home. Also, because we are able to finish tilings quickly we have more time for other activities that we wish to do.
### What do you think is the most useful thing that man has ever discovered? 
I think that the most important discovery was electricity. Without electricity we would not have any of the modern equipment that we have today. We would be unable to have phones, computers, lights, TVs. refrigerators, or music players. Electricity runs almost everything in our houses and work areas today.
