## Questions
### Have computers (the items you chose to talk about) changed much over the years? 
Yes. computers have changed so much since they first came out. The first computer took up a whole, huge room. Today, computers are so small you can put them easily into a shoulder bag. Some are even small enough to fit into your pocket.
### What kinds of electrical appliances are used most? 
I use computers every day and they arc used in almost every area of my life. I also use printers often to print out the information that I have put together on my computer and give it to someone else. In my kitchen there are also some electrical appliances that I use every day like toasters, microwaves, and refrigerators. A coffee maker is an appliance not used much here in China, but probably is used more in the U.S. and Europe.
### Do you think we can live without electrical appliances? 
I think it is possible for people to live without electrical appliances. However, people arc so used to having them and living with them that I think it would be very difficult, especially if the change is very sudden. I think that it’s not good for people to be so dependent on machines to do things for them. I think that people should learn how to live and do things without machines and appliances so that if there is ever a time when they don’t have them, it will be easier to adjust.
### Do you think science and technology will one day completely eliminate traditional skills and equipment? 
I think that it is very possible, but I don’t think that this is good. Right now it’s very hard to keep up with technology so what would it be like if it was all replaced? It is almost hard to fathom. Well you know if we ever run out of oil it seems to me that a lot of the technology would change.
### How do you think electrical appliances will develop in the future? 
I think we will have electrical appliances that will do many of the jobs and duties that require less thinking. Jobs like cooking, cleaning, and repairing may soon be taken over by machines and very intelligent appliances. We may soon have appliances that can have dinner on the table by the time a mother and father have come home from work and the child has come home from school. We may have appliances that will clean the house and make the beds, fix the sink and paint the walls.
### What arc some of the different forms of electronic communication that people use in offices today? 
The most common form of communication in the office is email. Even between people next to or near each other it is becoming more common to just type out an email or memo. Another very common form of communication is the phone. No matter where someone is they will almost always have an office phone or a cell phone.
### What are the effects of using such electronic forms of communication? 
One of the main effects of using electronic communication is that the communications become less personal. There is a feeling of just communicating with machines and not talking to a human. Of course, it is much more convenient to be able to send an email to someone rather than going to where they arc to ask them or tell them something. It is also much quicker to call someone than to find them and talk to them personally.
