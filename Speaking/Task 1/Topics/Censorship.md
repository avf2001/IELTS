## Questions
### What do you think about censorship?
**Sample 1**  
I believe in it. I think that some of the stuff that is available to the public is just pure garbage. Not censoring would be like allowing garbage to be strewn around your living room. I believe in freedom of speech but I believe that also goes along with a sense of responsibility of who would be around to hear it. Some things are just nor all audiences. Maybe censorship can go too far but if you have a good balance in what is censored it is not such a bad thing.
### Should films be classified before release?
**Sample 1**  
Of course this goes along with my previous answer. It is considered that there are certain types of content and portrayal that should be prohibited like sexual acts accompanied by offensive perversion. Besides, I hope that you donâ€™t think that I am being too negative on this subject but realistically speaking expanding the ratings of classifications would not be a bad idea. I think that the rating system is too simplistic and many more guidelines and ways to classify movies are long overdue.
