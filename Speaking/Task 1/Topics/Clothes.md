## Questions
### What type of clones do you like?
**Sample 1**  
I mostly like older styles, such as those during the 50s. I also like newer style like some kinds of punk clothes. I like skirts and dresses best. Loose types of clothing are most comfortable. I like to have nice, neat, stylish clothing, too.
### How do people choose what style of clothing to buy?
**Sample 1**  
Many people buy clothing because it is a new style or it’s a colour that they like. Often people will buy something because it looks like what a favorite movie star or singer wears. Other people buy clothes that suit them, or that they will wear most often. Other people just buy clothes because they are functional.
### Do you think the brand of clothing is important?
**Sample 1**  
Personally I don’t really care about the brand of clothing as long as what I buy is good quality. Famous brands are usually too expensive for me so I will rarely buy them. Often I can find inexpensive brands that are just as good a quality and very nice. Of course here in China you can get brand name clothes at a very cheap price.
### Why do some people buy brand-name clothes?
**Sample 1**  
Many people buy brand name clothing because they like the style. However, some people simply want their clothes to last a long time, so they buy a certain brand of clothing that is known for its good quality. Other people buy brand name clothing because they feel it make them look more stylish and hip. Some people just like to have that name on their clothing. I think it might make them feel important.
### Compare the materials and lash ions of today’s clothing with those of the past 
**Sample 1**  
In my opinion, older fashions changed more slowly and gradually from one to another. The faded into each other. Fashions of today change drastically in a very short period of time. Often certain clothes will only be in style for one year or so before another, very different style is in. Of course there are more choices to choose now.
### Do men and women have the same shopping habits when they buy clothes?
**Sample 1**  
No, they have very different shopping habits. Often men will shop less and only because they need new clothes. They often do not buy much, and they will spend less money on what they buy. Actually I think that they dread shopping and probably would rather go to the dentist. Women buy clothes more often and they usually pay more for their clothing. Often they will buy new clothes because they want to be in style. I think women also don’t mind spending money as long as it’s their boyfriend’s or husband’s.
### Sometimes factory workers and very often school students have in wear uniforms. What do you think of this?
**Sample 1**  
I think it helps reduce competition in the work or school area. When the workers or students don’t feel that they have to keep up with someone else’s clothes or style, they are able to concentrate on work or study. The bad side to it is that if the uniform is uncomfortable or docs not look very smart or stylish, it makes work or school unpleasant for some people. Also it can make people feel that they have no individuality and are just like everyone else.

### What kind of clothes do you usually wear?
### Do you ever wear the traditional clothes of your country?
### Where do you usually buy your clothes?
### Have you ever worn a uniform?
### Do most people in your country follow fashion?
### What clothes do you usually like to wear? 
Well, actually I don't have any instinct for fashion and my look says I'm a laid-back kind of guy. So I usually wear casual clothes. I'm most comfortable wearing jeans, a T-shirt and my flip-flops.
### Do/did you wear the same clothes at school and at home? 
Oh, definitely not. I always wore school uniform which was a blue jacket with a white shirt. They were very simple and boring. So when I reached home, I tended to put on my favourite outfits.
### Will you change your clothes when you go home today? 
Oh, yes. Formal clothes really make me nervous so when I go home, I take them off and change into my sweatshirts.
### Did you have any special clothes to wear when you where a child?
Yes, when I was a child, I needed to wear a uniform at school from primary school all the way to the very last year of high school : it is a tradition in China, so I believe my parents had to follow this tradition too.
### Did you like them?
No, I really couldn#t stand the school uniform because the clothes were a bit too old- fashioned : in addition, sometimes I was reluctant to wear them because they were too large. I don’t know why they couldn't be a bit more trendy and colourful like the ones in other countries, like Japan and Australia.
### Do you think wearing a hat on sunny days is important?
It is widely understood that radiation from the sun has extreme detrimental impacts on our health, especially our skin which can cause several skin problems ranging from sunburn to cancer. As a result, applying sunscreen or wearing a hat on sunny days to reduce sunlight exposure is crucial. This not only saves you from skin issues but helps to decelerate aging process in general.
### Did you wear a hat as a child? Why?
Unfortunately, I was kind of stubborn and disobedient when I was younger, therefore, despite my mother’s warnings, I rarely put on a hat or jacket to cover my skin when playing outside. You don’t usually pay much attention to your physical appearance when you’re a kid, don’t you? Or at least that was what I and most of my friends used to think. However, it’s not too late to start wearing a hat and protect your skin now.
### What is the importance of a hat?
Many has considered a hat a trivial piece of clothing for covering purpose only, yet, stylists and designers around the world have turned hats into not only useful but fashionable accessories to meet market’s demands as well. Beside their initial and major function as sunshades, hats are now playing big roles in complementing one’s outfit, making them ones of the most necessary items in every girl’s closet.
