## Questions
### What do you do in your holidays? 
Sometimes I travel to broaden my horizons, to admire the beauty of nature and to plunge myself into the picturesque landscape in other regions in my country. Every now and then, I just stay at home with my family and have a little get-together to celebrate the holidays.
### Who do you usually spend holiday with? 
It depends on what kind of holiday it is. If it’s Christmas vacation, I prefer hang out with my friends here and there and have a chit-chat. If it’s New Year holiday, I just want to celebrate the holiday with my family and relatives in a cozy ambiance.
### Do you prefer travelling alone or in a group? 
I would say that I’m kind of an introvert so I would rather travel alone to some tranquil and peaceful beauty spots than travel with a group of people during the holiday.
### Why are holidays and important to you? 
Holiday is a perfect time for recharging my batteries after a year full of challenges and obstacles, having some me time and planning ahead for the upcoming year.
### If you could take a holiday anywhere in the world, where would you go? Why? 
If the choice is in my hands, I’m yearning for travelling to […..] on Christmas vacation when the weather is neither too cold or too hot. There I can contemplate the picturesque scenery.
