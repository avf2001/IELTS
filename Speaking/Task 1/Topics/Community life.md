## Questions
### Do you think it’s important to take part in local activities? 
I personally don’t enjoy participating in local events, but for some reason many people actually do. I’d much rather watch the event from a distance. Maybe this is just because I’m lazy, but I just don’t really feel the need to go out there and be another nameless person in a crowd that won t miss me at all.
### Do you think it’s important to have a sense of local community spirit? 
If a community wants to prosper, everyone must make a concerted effort to put as much into their community as possible. If you don’t take care of your community then your community can’t take care of you. What I’m trying to say is that if you’re in the habit of helping others in your community, then others will he more inclined to help you. It’s also important that you don’t litter, because if you do then the place will look like a mess. Another tiling that would help is that if parents and pet owners would clean tip after their kids and pets relieve themselves then there won’t be any excrement on the grass, sidewalks, and benches.
### What arc the advantages of being part of close-knit community? 
Well, one of the advantages is that your community will look out for you. If you’re in trouble you’ll get support from your neighbors, and they’ll be more likely to accept whatever you decide to do. Also, if you are in a close-knit community, more people will be your friend and invite you and your family over to their house for dinner. Like the saying goes, a man is only as rich as how many friends he has. A man is only as rich as how many friends he has.
### In what ways do neighbors cooperate and help each other in China? 
This is a tough question, because I personally don’t think that they do. Most of my neighbors are just nosey old busybodies who are always trying to find out some new piece of gossip. All the rest are out working all day and when they come home they just want to watch TV or sleep.
### How has the sense of community changed in recent years in China? 
Before the community was very strong in China. You always did things with your neighbors and helped them in whatever way that you could. Also, whenever anyone did something that wasn’t quite right, everyone knew about it, and the person was very embarrassed. But now everyone is out working, and aside from a few old busybodies. no one has time to help or get involved with the affairs of their neighbors.
