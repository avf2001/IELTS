## Questions
### Does the Chinese government control advertisements in any way? 
Of course. All TV media is controlled in some way by the government, so advertisements must be as well. The government prevents advertisements from having inappropriate content or content that is not in line with government policy. That is common in every country. I’m sure that if the advertisement is within normal bounds, then the government wouldn’t have much to say about it.
### Do you think there should be controls on advertising? 
Yes, I do. Some things should not be advertised, such as cigarettes, which arc harmful to people’s health. Most people arc aware of their existence, so they don’t need to be promoted more. Children especially should not be shown advertisements that make harmful things look cool or interesting. Advertisements that have age-inappropriate content should also be banned.
### Do you think that advertisements for products that harm the health, such as cigarettes, should be allowed? 
Now you arc getting into freedom of choice and whether it would be better to just prohibit something from being advertised to get people to stop using the product, but unfortunately this just doesn’t work, as prohibition in the States found out. The best thing would be for the products just to not be manufactured, but this doesn’t work either because then they would be produced illegally, becoming more dangerous.
### Can you think of any example of false advertising? 
The biggest example that comes to my mind is McDonald’s advertisements. Every time 1 go to McDonald’s, I see pictures of happy, thin people with big smiles and perfect teeth holding hamburgers and cartons of French fries that are at least three tunes bigger than the real products. This advertisement clearly ignores three glaring facts. For one, if you cat at McDonalds a lot, you will not look like the people in the advertisement. Two, the hamburger and French fries are nowhere near the size pictured. Three, if you stand smiling lidding a burger, nobody will think you are cool.
### What kinds of products are most often (most easily) promoted by false advertising? 
Well, most products are really promoted by false advertising. I hate to sound so cynical but I have a friend in the advertising business, and a lot of so-called experts advertising their product know absolutely nothing about it. In the Held of beauty care products, this happens a lot. The poor women sitting at home with nothing to do except watch TV me so susceptible In this kind of advertising.
