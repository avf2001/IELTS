## Questions
### Do you often look at yourself in the mirror? 
Frankly speaking, I suppose it has to be at least once every two hours, which is quite often. I don’t think that’s a big issue since I am a woman and every woman makes great effort to maintain her best look, especially in public. Furthermore, mirrors are placed almost everywhere such as in the restrooms, in a working place as decorations, which is too tempting for me to ignore.
### Have you ever bought a mirror? 
A girl couldn’t survive without a decent pocket mirror which is portable and convenient bring along anywhere. Collecting these small pieces of art is one of my hobbies, too. Whenever I am in good mood, I usually wander around some flea markets to pick up some of these vintage, yet tasteful accessories for myself or as gifts for friends and family. There are at least ten pocket mirrors in my possession which are beautifully designed with different unique patterns.

It’s safe to say architects and interior designers are making full use of mirrors in house building and decorating thanks to their inherent characteristics and wide application.
