## Questions
### Do you spend your free time at home or outside? 
Starting to go to work means that I have a craving for my free time. Whenever I have a day off, I always enjoy those moments by staying at home and sleeping. The reason for this choice is because I have to work outside all day, so my house is a perfect place for me to let my hair down.
### What do you do in free time? 
To me, free time is such a precious gift from the busy pace of life. Hence, I always do my favorite things in my free time. Since I am still a postgraduate, I often enhance my English by watching films. Then I sometimes bake some cakes for my snacks for the following week.
### Do you like to spend your free time with families or friends? 
Well, there’s no denying that families are the best thing that people have. Therefore, I prefer spending my free time with my beloved family to with my friends. I love doing that because that’s only the time I can sit with my parents and seek for advice about my daily problems.
### What do you do to relax? 
Normally, I'll hang out with my friends because I want to relax, but after being a father, I spend more time at home with my kid, telling stories to him or playing games with him.
### Do you prefer to stay at home in the evenings or do you prefer to go out? 
If I had to choose between the two, I'll probably spend more time at home with my kid, telling stories to him or playing games with him, whereas, hanging out with friends will reduce my quality family time with my son.
### Do you think modern lifestyles give people enough time for leisure? 
Oh, definitely not, you know, a modern lifestyle brings people more convenience, however, in this modern fast paced society the fierce competition makes more people spend more time at work, resulting in less quality time with family and friends.
### Do you think it#s important for people to have leisure time? 
Yes, definitely. After a tiring week, people really need to relax. Apart from earning money, I still need to enjoy my family time, hang out with friends to socialise and travel around to experience different lifestyles.
### Do old people and young people spend their leisure time in the same way? 
Well, between the two, old people are fond of a slow-pace of life compared to young people, for example, old people enjoy walking in the garden or chatting with old friends, on the contrary, young people are fond of energetic activities such as football and hiking in the mountains.
### How do people in your country spend their holidays? 
Well, it's kind of hard to say but people that I know around me tend to hang out with friends for dinner, but maybe for others, they will probably go shopping with family in the shopping malls to enjoy themselves.
### If you had a child, what leisure places would you go to with your child? 
Well, I'm really into taking my kid travelling around to the natural places around here during the weekends to relax. Although travelling to other places is really time consuming, I still like going out because I believe that staying close to the nature can cultivate people' s mental development
### Compare the way old people and young people spend their leisure time. 
Many old people spend their leisure time indoors, silting down, reading a hook or resting : or they might go outside for a brisk walk in the evening. Many of them enjoy watching TV or knitting. Young people, on the other hand, enjoy a variety of things. Many do the same things I mentioned that old people do, but in my opinion there are many more options available if you arc young. You can play sports, go clubbing all night, participate in extreme sports like bungee jumping or sky diving—that might give an older person a heart attack.
### Do people today have more leisure time than before?
I think that since modem appliances have cut down the amount of unnecessary physical work we need do, there is more time for leisure. You don’t have to gather wood to make a fire, and you don’t have to spend 1 or 2 hours lighting your fire. Cell phones and instant messaging make it possible to communicate immediately with your friends and associates, cutting back on time needed to wait for telegraphs or snail mail replies. The only problem is that even though everything is so much easier, there are other complications that people in the past didn’t have, such as traffic jams and long lines at the supermarket. Also it really depends on the person, because I know some people who never rest or take time off. They’re always working and never stop. But I also know some guys who are the total opposite: they make every excuse why they can’t do what’s being asked of them, and I imagine that in the past it was the same.
### Do you think leisure time is important? (Why? )
Yes, I think that leisure time is very important. Like the saying goes, “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.” If you’re working nonstop and never take the time to let your hair down, you’ll most likely get stressed out and even get sick. If I don’t take some time to just relax a bit every week, I end up getting sick, and have to stay in bed for a few days. So in my opinion leisure time is vital to maintaining health and sanity.
### How have leisure activities changed in China in the past few years?
Well, for one thing, many more Chinese, mostly young people, have been spending a lot more time on their computers, either playing games, studying, doing research and business, or any number of things. Before, if you wanted to relax, you just went for a walk, read a book, or played mahjong with friends. Now die possibilities are endless. Many people still relax in the traditional ways, but many more are finding new and different ways to spend their leisure time.
### How do you think leisure-time activities will change in the future?
You know what? I have absolutely no idea! I mean, 10 years ago, did you think that modem technology would be as advanced as it is now? They have mp3 and mp4 players, who knows, they might come out with an mp5 next year where you actually experience what you’re seeing. Computers are getting smaller and smaller, someday you might have to use a microscope to view your computer screen. Music players for that mutter are also gelling smaller, slimmer and more compact. A few years from now you might be able to get an mp3 player in a little chip under your skin that’s controlled by your brain.
