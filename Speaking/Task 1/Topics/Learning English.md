## Questions
### Why do people learn English in China? 
I believe people learn English in order to adapt to the shrinking of the world. In this day and age, contact and business from country to country is EXTREMELY easy, and as a result, language has become a barrier that you must overcome if you want to participate. Therefore, learning English for most people is a great way to be able to do business or make friends with foreigners. I think it’s really positive.
### Some people say that if you are going to work in a Chinese company in China, then learning English is a waste of time. Do you agree? 
I do not agree at all with this statement for several reasons. First, how do you know you are always going to lie working for a Chinese company? If you can speak English well, you might be able to get a better job in an international company. Secondly, why does language-learning only have to be about business? If you can speak English, you have expanded the number of friends you can possibly make. I have made friends with Chinese people only because they spoke English. I think the above statement is just an excuse given by people who don’t want to try to learn new things.
### What do you think is the best age for children to begin learning English? 
I believe that children should start learning foreign languages as early as possible. If they can, they should try and learn other languages as they are learning their native language. It has been proven that kids can pick up languages easier than adults. They are less set in their ways and more open to new things. 1 have a cousin who has a Mexican mother, an American father, and is living in Cairo, Egypt. He is only one year old now, but is already picking up Spanish, English, and Arabic. Learning as a child saves a lot of hassle as an adult.
### Would you say it’s better to study English overseas than in China? 
I believe that for most people, this is not possible. Either it’s too expensive or they can’t find the time or a way to live in a foreign country, so it’s out of the question. However, if they can arrange it, it is definitely easier to learn a foreign language in that country. Being surrounded by people speaking the language you are trying to leant is extremely helpful. The best way to do it, I think, is to take classes of a language to build a base, then go. That way, when you get to the country, you aren’t totally overwhelmed.
### Do adults have more difficulties than children in learning a foreign language? 
Yes. I believe this wholeheartedly. Adults who have been speaking one language for a long period of time may find many difficulties in learning a new language. They will also easily fall into the patterns of their native language, making learning hard. Kids, however, are still learning their native language, so they don’t have established patterns to fall back on. As a result, new material is a lot easier for them to learn.
