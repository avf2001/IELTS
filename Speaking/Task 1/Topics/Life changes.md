## Questions
### What kind of events may be life-changing events? 
Like I said, breaking tip or ending a relationship would be one. Having an accident or hurting yourself when playing sports sure is life changing. Winning the lottery is another life changing event. Getting married will change your life, too.
### Do Chinese people change jobs very often? Do you think that’s good? 
Yes I think that Chinese do change their jobs pretty often, and I think that it is a good thing. Until you really find a job that you feel comfortable with, then I think it is okay to change jobs. Some Chinese and people around the world have to change jobs because they get laid off or their company gets gobbled up by some big corporation, and they are forced to leave.
### How do you think employers could encourage employees not to change jobs? 
Of course they could give a lot of money, but I know that this is not always practical. I think that one thing that would really help people stay in a job is that they are shown some appreciation for what they do. I read that a lack of appreciation is one reason that people go from job to job and just can’t seem to find a home. I think if employers would just listen to their employees about their need, that would be a big help, too.
### Why do so many people in China move to a different city or even go overseas to study or work? 
Well. I think that people are just looking for their groove and where they belong. Now that the opportunity is there to travel, people want to take advantage of it, and see where their fortunes lie. There is a big world out there and some people want to find out if it is their “cup of tea” as they say. I hate to use so many idioms and I hope that I am using them right, but some people just have the proverbial “grass is greener on the other side of the fence” syndrome. They think that once they get there, all their problems will be over.
### What do you think are the major challenges of working or studying in another country? 
Well. I guess that one of the biggest ones is that you arc going to a different culture, and you are not sure how you are going to lit in. In most countries one of the hardest things to deal with is prejudice. People always seem to have a little suspicion of foreigners in their country. I think that loneliness would he another thing that would he hard for someone working or studying overseas. A person would be away from family and friends, and that would be difficult.
