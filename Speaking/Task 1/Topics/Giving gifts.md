## Questions
### Do Chinese people often give gifts? 
Yes, we do. Not as much as western cultures, but we receive gifts on our birthday and at Chinese New Year. Sometimes if we visit someone that we don’t see very often, they might get a small gilt. Of course, when someone gets married, people will give them gilts.
### What kinds of presents do Chinese people give? 
I think the most popular gift is the Chinese ‘hong bao‘ or ‘red envelope’. Money is put in these red envelopes and given at birthdays, weddings, and Chinese New Year. People will sometimes buy other gifts for these occasions. If it is for a child, they might give a toy or stuffed animal. Sometimes food is given as a gift, either having been cooked by the giver, or store-bought.
### On what occasions do Chinese people send gifts? 
People send gilts mostly on birthdays or Chinese New Year. These are the traditional times for gift-giving, but as many Western holidays and traditions arc slowly becoming more popular in China, it is quite acceptable to give your friends a gift at Christmas, or your sweetheart a gift on Valentine’s Day. Even though some people may not know why different festivals are celebrated, they still enjoy the chance to show the people they care about how they feel.
### If you were going to give a present to a child, what would you give them? 
Well, if it were a boy, I would get him a Lego set. The reason why I would choose a Lego set is that it is very fun and at the same time, it encourages creativity. If it were a girl, I would give her a glass doll. I would give this to her because most little girls like dolls, and if it were glass she would take better care of it and treasure it more because it could break easily.
### Do people give the same kinds of gifts to both boys and girls? 
I think some people give both boys and girls the same kinds of gifts because they don’t know what to give, so they just get them the same thing. Other people may do this if two children are friends or siblings and the person doesn’t want them to fight over different toys, and if they have the same thing, they will be happy. Or people may not know that girls and boys like different things, so they don’t think about whether the gift they arc getting is suitable for that child.
