## Questions
* Do you like bags? 
    > Bag is not really must-have item to me. I just use a backpack due to its convenience. Probably I’ll spend some time getting to know more about bags later on.
* What types of bags do you like? 
    > I’m not a big fan of this item so the only bag I use from time to time is the backpack. I love backpack because I tend to put a lot of heavy stuff inside such as my laptop, my water bottles, etc. whenever I get outdoors. It’s the long-term convenience that makes high-quality backpacks worth my money.
* Do you usually carry a bag (when you go out)? 
    > As aforementioned I carry my backpack all the time, when I go to school or hang out with friends. Although it may not give me a fashionable look, I think comfort and convenience is the top priority to me.
* Do you have different bags for different occasions (or, different purposes)? 
    > Well I must say that at present I have no idea about different types of bags or that sort of things. And it also costs me an arm and a leg if I ever want to become a bag collector with, say, twenty different bags for different occasions. However, I do have one fashionable small satchel for special occasions. I’m also kind of afraid that wearing heavy bags all the time will somehow affect my spine and my shoulders.
* What do you put in these bags? 
    > Well, when I go out or go to work, I usually put my laptop, cellphone, charger, basic beauty products like lipsticks, lotions , water bottle and probably a pair of earphones. When I use the smaller backpack, I tend to leave everything at home but my makeup kit and water bottles.
* What sorts of bags do women like to buy? 
    > I think every women regardless of age, occupation, tastes, needs, etc has at least one backpack with them. As I’ve already explained about its convenience, backpack is ideal for everyday life. However, the top favorite bag would be the well-designed handbag.
