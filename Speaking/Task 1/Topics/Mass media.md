## Questions
### How do most people in China get their news?
Most Chinese people get their news from various newspapers. Everyday, I see people reading newspapers on the bus, on the subway, or on the street. Also many people get their news from the Internet and TV.
### Are most people in China more interested in local news or international news? 
I think most Chinese people are more concerned with local news and domestic news, which I’d imagine is the same across the world. Unless there are huge stories going on elsewhere, local news has more of an impact on the average citizen. Also, it is easier to understand news that is about areas that you know as opposed to some town in a country you might not even have heard of.
### Compare newspapers and TV as sources of news. 
I think if you are looking lo gel a general idea about the day’s news, TV is a perfect way. You can get the basics from TV. If you want 10 get in-depth information, however, newspapers arc the way to go. They can dedicate more time to each individual story, so you can learn more about different subjects.
### How do you think the news media will change in the future? 
News in the future, I think, will come from many more directions. With the creation of blogs, more people are able to report on many different things, so you will see a lot more news and a lot more analysis. I don’t think there is any way that newspapers will be able to compete with this. If people have to choose between getting more news for free online and to pay, they are going to choose lo go online.
### Are young and old people interested in the same news content? 
I think this question partially depends on how old young people are. If they are in their twenties, I think for the most part, the news they are interested in is the same. Younger people do seem to be more interested in tilings like celebrities and pop culture than older people, but 1 think they stay pretty educated about the more important news. Older people are less concerned with the pop culture news, and are more concerned with the news that matters more to the world and their country.
