## Questions
* Do you think it’s useful for adults to attend classes to further their education? 
    > Sure, why not, if it is something that they find useful in their lives and something that they enjoy. Learning is lifelong and I don’t know if it has to stop in old age. Now I know that a lot of times these adults are looked upon as teachers, but if they feel so inclined why not attend a class to further their education. If they are not able to keep up with the young students then this would be a detriment, but if there are no disruptions why not?
* What kinds of courses exist in China for adults? 
    > There are wonderful exercise classes that are available for adults in China. I don’t know if you have seen large groups of older women out on the streets performing with various percussion instruments, but these are classes that help them to work together and perform for audiences. There are dancing classes available. There are even English classes available for senior citizens in China. There are Tai Chi classes also available to seniors here. As time goes on and the country develops there will be more classes that will be available for seniors.
* What are some reasons why adults might attend classes? 
    > Well I guess one of the main ones is that they are working and they need to keep up with the latest technology that will help them to stay abreast of the latest in their fields. Sometimes they might even be thinking of switching careers so they take classes to get the training to do so. Other times they might just want to learn some things in their spare time that will enhance their life on a recreational level. Other times their bosses might want them to learn some special skill for the good of the company.
* Who do you think should pay for adult education—the government, the student or the company (if it is a work-related course)? 
    > Again it depends on the course and why they are taking it. If it is for personal gain or gratification then of course students should be responsible to pay for it. If the government is offering a course and adults are interested in it then it is already paid for. If it is going to move the company ahead and bring financial results then of course the company should pay for it. Now if the company can’t pay for it and it interests the individual then it is up to him to get the money together to attend the class.
