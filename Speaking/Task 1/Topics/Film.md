## Questions
### Do you like to watch films? 
I'm really into watching films because some films are very entertaining and provoking. I sometimes go to cinema with my friends and family to enjoy our leisure time in the weekends.
### Do you prefer foreign films or Chinese films? 
Well, if I had to choose between the two, I would probably choose foreign films, especially Hollywood films because most of them are well-acted, with lots of charismatic celebrities and are often enormous box-office hits : whereas you know, Chinese films are usually low-budget, so they are not as attractive as their American counterparts.
### How often do you go to a cinema or watch a movie?
I go to cinema to watch movies from time to time. Normally if I’m not busy with my work, I’ll check out the movies to see whether there are any movies that attract me : but if I have lots of things on my hands, I'll probably focus on my work.
### Do Chinese people like to go to a cinema to watch a film?
It's kind of hard to say but people that I know tend to like watching movies in the cinema, but maybe for others, they just prefer to stay at home and watch TV programmes
### What kinds of movies do you like best?
As for me, I like drama films the best because sometimes they just tell simple but warm and heartfelt stories with provoking and often emotional endings which touch me a lot.
### What was the first film that you watched?
The first film that I watched was the Lion King many years ago in the cinema with my parents. What I can remember now is the terrific animation and the amazing soundtrack. I particularly liked the song Can You Feel the Love Tonight that I knew it was produced by Elton John. And I've learned lessons from this movie. It is about living up to our responsibilities, no matter how hard it is.
### What kind of films is the most popular in your country?
Well Hollywood blockbusters are very popular here, film like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan. Also Hongkong films are very popular because the stars are well known here. Kungfu films are popular because this art form originated here. Of course love stories are very popular as well as historical films.
### Do old people and young people like watching the same kinds of films? (Compare the differences.)
Well I think that old people like to watch stories about their country since they wore so involved in this time period. They also like to watch a variety of programmes that show the native singing and dancing from different regions in my country. Young people on the other hand go for the foreign films, as I already mentioned. There are some films that both young and old like to watch such as historical movies.
### What do you think people can learn from watching films? (or should films be considered as entertainment only?)
Oh I think that people can learn so much from films. You know there is an old saying that goes “A wise man learns from his mistakes, but a wiser learns from the mistakes of others.” Just by watching a movie and seeing what a character does in certain circumstances, you know whether you should do something or not. You can see picturesque sceneries that you might not be able to see if it were not for movies. So definitely, you can learn from watching films.
### To what extent do you think films reflect real life?
Well it is a big argument that has been around for a long time. Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? I believe that each reflects on the other. Sometimes films observe life and comment on it and sometimes life observes film and imitates it . Film is a powerful medium and brings many parts of life to the public for observation.
### Do you think that film stars deserve the large incomes that some of them receive?
From my viewpoint, celebrities deserve as much money as they make per movie or episode. Though actors have a choice to choose between their roles, but once they have signed something, they have to completely work their socks off to reach the director’s expectations. They help the director achieve his dream and only when they are paid, they give their best. Besides, acting is work, and unlike many jobs, it requires real skill. There’s a definite difference in quality between actors of different skill levers. That being said, it’s hard to justify some of the outrageous price tags of the most famous actors. These are not necessarily being paid for their skill, but for their fame and ability to bring people into theatres. At a certain level, film watchers ‘re paying for fame instead of talent.
