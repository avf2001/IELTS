## Questions
### Should businesses support local events? 
I think that businesses should support local events. It not only helps to create a good image for the business, but shows customers that the business is interested in their welfare. It can also provide good advertising opportunities for the business. Everyone likes to do business with a community-minded business.
### Should the government preserve traditional events like temple fairs? 
I think the government should preserve this kind of event. And furthermore, I think that the best way they can support them is to help financially. Although if you only let the government help to support and sponsor these kinds of events, then companies like Coca Cola, Budweiser, and McDonald’s will have nothing to do. Therefore, I think it’s important to let everyone help to organize and fund the events, but the government should definitely preserve and support these kinds of events.
