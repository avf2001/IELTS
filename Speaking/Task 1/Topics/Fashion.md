## Questions
### How much do overseas fashion trends influence China? 
Overseas fashion treads, especially in the Korean styles greatly affect the styles in China. For young people, dressing like the young people do oversees is very important. Often a style will come into China a bit later than it does to the rest of the western world, but when it catches on in China it spreads very quickly. When you travel to cities such as Shanghai or Dalian, you can really see the influence of foreign fashion here in China society. With TV and fashion models and more here in China, it is a lot easier to follow these trends.
