## Questions
### What do you do in your spare time? 
Because I’d prefer staying at home, I spend a lot of my spare time on my hobbies. Usually I’ll start by turning on some music. If I have plenty of time, I’ll get straight to dancing or drawing. Otherwise, if it’s just a quick break, social network would definitely a good choice.
### Do you like outdoor activities? 
Sadly I must say no. Since getting outdoor involves choosing clothes, meeting people and sometimes standing the weather, so most of the time I’d prefer staying inside. If I’m free I can invite some friends to come over. We can still have fun without going out.
### What outdoor activities do you (most) like to do? 
The outdoor activity I like to do best is my photography tour, especially when the weather is perfectly fine. I would walk around campus to find inspiration. It could be a flower, the sunshine or the road I walk everyday.
### How often do you do that? 
For the past few weeks I’m so busy that I hardly have time to go on my photography tours. Previously I get outside three times a week and depending on the weather condition, I could go out more or less often than that.
### What outdoor sports do you like? (Why?) 
Definitely swimming, especially during the summer. Not only is swimming good for my health, it also helps me get in shape. Besides, I sometimes go jogging to enjoy fresh air.
### How much time do you spend outdoors every week? 
As I’ve already mentioned, I’m quite busy these days for any physical exercises. If going to the supermarket or go window-shopping are also considered as ‘getting outdoors’ then yeah, I guess I get outdoor once a week.
### How often do you do outdoor activities? 
I’m afraid not too often. I mean it’s not in my favor now. These days I’m so busy that most of the time I get outdoor is to go to school. Although I still hang out with friends, but basically we prefer having drink and a little chit chat instead of doing some sports.

I don’t really think so. Now with so many modem conveniences there’s less need In work- outdoors : There are so many offices and indoor jobs now that’s almost considered “low class” to do manual labor or work outside. Most middle-class working people do not get sufficient amounts of exercise, and as a result are weak and more prone to sickness.

## Do old and young people like doing the same kinds of activities outdoors?
It really depends on the people playing sports, because some old people are very til and can keep up with the younger ones quite well. But for the most part old people generally don’t exert themselves physically as much us the younger ones do. They’d much rather take a walk or play badminton than climb a mountain or play a full-court game of basketball.
