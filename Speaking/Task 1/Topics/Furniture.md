## Questions
### When (in what situations) do people in China buy furniture? 
Most people buy furniture at a few main points in their lives. Naturally when people arc getting married is one of those times. Another time is when they buy a new flat.
### How do people decide what furniture to buy for the home or office? What factors do they consider? 
Well, they will consider what kind of furniture is needed. They w ill also look at which room it will go in and how much space they have. The women especially will think about color and style and what design looks best to them. I’d say price is probably the deciding point. They might like something very much, but if it’s too expensive they won’t be able to buy it.
### In Chinese families, who usually decides what furniture to buy for the home? 
I think it varies from family to family Nowadays, couples are making more decisions together. In my family, my parents even ask me what I think or like. In the past, often the men made decisions that concerned money, but some of those things are changing now.
### Do people in China prefer traditional or modem styles of furniture? 
That also depends on the people and the families. I don’t think there is any set preference. From my experience though, I would say many younger couples prefer modem furniture. I think it goes along with other trends in our country. What I mean is that modern or foreign fashions are often more popular and interesting, especially for young people. Maybe I’m different in this way though because I think many pieces of traditional furniture in our country arc very beautiful. They are also often made better than the modern things.
### Have there been any recent changes in the kinds of furniture that people (in China) use? 
Well, as I said a lot of foreign influence has come into China and this is affecting what people buy, including furniture. A very popular furniture store right now in China is IKEA, this is a store from Sweden and its style of furniture is a big change from the recent and distant past. I think that if people have the money they may return to the quality furniture from years gone by. Over all, though, the predominant style of furniture that people in China use is modern.
### What factors should a furniture designer consider when designing a piece of furniture? 
The use of the particular piece would lie the first consideration. A designer would also have to think of the market he is targeting. This would usually indicate the cost of the finished product. This in turn will influence what materials he can use within that price range, in turn price range.
### What are the qualities of a good furniture designer? 
I’d say he needs to he artistic and imaginative. At the same time a designer also has to have quite a bit of practical sense. It’s generally no use to design something that is beautiful bill impossible to construct. Or maybe the designer can figure out how to build it. but il ends up so expensive that no one can afford it. In any design field, there are people who design something more for art’s sake: they don’t really expect anyone to buy it or they hope to find a collector to buy it as a piece of art more than as something useful.
