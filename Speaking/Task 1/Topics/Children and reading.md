## Questions
### Do you think it‘s a good idea to teach children to read before they start school?
**Sample 1**  
Yes, I think it’s important to try to teach children how to read at as early an age as possible. The earlier they know how to read, the sooner they can start learning other things. Also, if you teach them early, it may instill a desire in them to keep learning throughout their lives, which would be extremely valuable. I know my parents started me reading very young, and today I think I am better off because of it.
### What kinds of things do children like to read?
**Sample 1**  
I think kids all over the world like to read books that are either based in the same world they are in (school) or in a world that isn’t like this one at all (fantasy/Harry Potter). Everything else, I think, fails to hold their attention. Unless it has a good, entertaining story, kids will not be interested, and I think these kinds of books kids can either identify with or can get.
### Do you think the Internet will influence the way people read in the future? (How?)
**Sample 1**  
Yes, I think the Internet will have an impact, though I’m not sure what that will be. I imagine that sometime, someone will invent something that is the size of a book, so people can download books onto it, and it will be easier to read than a computer screen. Then, from there, through the Internet, it will be extremely easy for people to read any book they could possibly imagine. Also, I think the Internet will give people the ability to read stuff that they are interested in. There is so much content that people will be able to find anything, so people’s tastes will get highly specific.
