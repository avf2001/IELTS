## Questions
### Are there many (or, any) museums in your hometown? 
There are a lot of museums in Nanjing because Nanjing has a central place in the history of China. It allows the local residents to know more about their traditions and historical celebrities.
### Do you often visit a museum? 
I go to the museums a lot, when I go to a new place, I'll find the local museums that have interesting features. The museum I visited last time was the Guanfu Museum located in the rural area of Beijing. It is a private-owned museum featuring Chinese antiques like porcelain, furniture, jade and some paintings.
### Do you think museums are important? 
Museums are really important in protecting, preserving, propagating and researching numerous human treasures. Once the antiques are in museums, they are permanently out of circulation, which means the public can see them.
### Do you think it#s suitable for museums to sell things to visitors? 
Yes, the reason is that generally, most museums are non-profit organisations, and these goods make up a large part of their income, except for the tickets of course, and also partly because these items are closely related to the theme of the museums, which cannot be bought in other bookstores or shops.
### Does China have many museums? What kind? 
Yes, there are many. In the places that I’ve been most of the museums are about dinosaurs or stars. There are also some marine, bird and insect museums. Often there’s a little bit of all of them mixed into one museum.
### Are museums popular in China? 
Not so popular. They are mostly for children or students. Sometimes you will see a whole family go to a museum or perhaps a young couple, but it is quite rare. Sometimes grandparents would take their grandchildren there.
### How could museums attract more visitors? 
I think if the museums had more interactive exhibits, then they would be more interesting for most people. It would also help people to leant more from actually being able to see first-hand what is happening and how different things work. Having exhibits that change each week or so would make people who have already been there want to go again to sec something new. Also people who have not gone yet would want to go as soon as they can so they don’t miss something, whereas if it’s always the same then they would put it off, thinking they catch it later.
### Do you think people should have to pay to visit museums? 
I think it’s not a good idea for people to have to pay all the time. I think it’s a good idea for part or most of the museum to be free, but if people want to sec certain parts or participate in special things, then they have to pay. If people have to pay each time they go, and especially if it’s expensive, then many won’t go or won’t go very often. The reason why I think this is bad is that I think it’s very educational to he able to look at and learn from all the tilings in museums.
### How will museums change in the future? 
I think that museums will become more modernized and more accurate. I think that they will have better and more interesting exhibits. The way they are set up and advertised I think will also improve so that they are more appealing to the general public. I think they will also have more interesting themes displayed and exhibited.
