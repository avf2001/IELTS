## Questions
### Do you like to help others? 
I am very happy to help others especially my neighbours. Getting alone well with your neighbours is very important if you want to lead a happy life.
### When was your last time you helped others? 
Well, let me tell you about a time when I helped someone who I was not familiar with. One morning, I met an old lady who lived in the same building as me in a local shop. She had just bought a bag of rice and was ready to take the heavy bag home. I saw that she was having problems trying to life it up. I walked straight over to her, and said that I would take the bag home for her. She was very thankful for my kindness. I could see that she really needed someone would stand out and do her a kind favour.
### Did your parents teach you the importance of helping others? 
When I was young, my parents and teachers taught me a lot about helping others. It is a core virtue in my culture, the solidarity of community is the thing that keeps members of society connected so we are always willing to help each other
### Have you ever refused to help others? 
Yeah, sometimes when I am in hurry or on business I don’t have time so I have to say sorry that I can’t help
### In general, why do people help others? 
I think it’s the kindness that exists in most human hearts, at least a little. Many of us have needed some help ourselves from time to time, and we know what it feels like to need something. We know it feels good to have help from others when we need it, so we want to help others in the same way. Also, as I mentioned before, often it simply makes us happy to help others in some way.
### Do you think it’s important to help people who need help? 
Of course it’s important. We have a responsibility to do our part whether it’s in our family, our workplace, or amongst friends. None of us are like little islands with nothing or no one around us. We influence each other, and contribute to the atmosphere and environment around us, at least we should. And just as we want others to help us, we should naturally be willing to help others.
### How do you feel after you have helped someone? 
Usually I feel very good when I’ve helped someone. Even if the help I gave was difficult for me or ai an inconvenient time. Even if it was a sacrifice for me, afterwards it seems that I am happier than when I began, and sometimes I even seem to have more energy or time left for myself. It may sound funny, but sometimes it seems a little like magic how I end up with more time or more energy or more money or whatever, after I have given some away to another person.
### Many people only look out for themselves and never think about helping others. What do you think of this attitude? 
I think it’s sad. I know it is common, but it’s a sad statement of modern life, at least in big cities. I know not everybody is that way, but nowadays a lot of people have become very selfish. It seems that so many people are in such a rush to get rich or get better jobs or into the best schools that they hardly even notice people who need help. Maybe if people were not so absorbed in their own worlds, they would see the needs more and would do something about it. At least I hope so.
### What is the most important way for a country to help visitors? 
Probably the most common form of help needed by foreigners is help with the language. I’ve also seen foreigners on the streets who seem to be a little lost. Sometimes they’re looking at their maps trying to find a famous tourist spot, so giving directions is another common way to help foreigners. I’ve done this a few times, and it was an interesting chance to talk to someone from another country.
### Do you think that countries should help other countries in need? 
Yes. by all means. Our country has helped other countries many times, such as after the tsunami caused so much damage in Thailand, Indonesia and India. We also sent aid to the United States after the severe hurricanes a few years ago. I think we should look at the world as a very large neighborhood, and if we can try and do as much as possible for our neighbors, everyone is a lot happier and friendlier towards each other.
### What kinds of people need help in China? 
I think one of the biggest groups in our society needing help is the farmers. It would be better if the wealth and economic progress in our country was more evenly distributed. I live in a fairly prosperous family. We’re not rich but we do have plenty, and though I’m happy for this, I feel a little guilty that others have so much less than I do.
### How does the government try to help these people? 
I think one of the main ways is by investing in business in a certain part of the country so that more jobs are created for the local people. Another way is by providing training, for example in farming, in ways that can increase productivity. Also the government should make sure that officials of the provinces are doing their jobs correctly. The government is trying to eliminate corruption at the local level.
### Are there any non-government organizations in China that help people? 
Yes, there are. At first many of these were foreign, but that is changing now. Although there are still foreign organizations that help people, there are also more and more Chinese charitable organizations being set up. I just read some articles about this.
### Where do these organizations get their money from? 
The foreign organizations get their money from overseas. Some of the binding is governmental, but a lot of it comes from private donations. Here in China, more individuals arc getting involved in charities. It’s relatively new, but with the increased income of people, there is more of an awareness of a need to help others who are less fortunate.
