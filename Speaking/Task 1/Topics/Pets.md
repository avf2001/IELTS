### Why do people have pets?
### Do many people in China like to have a pet? 
I think the number of Chinese who like pets is less than half the total population. Many Chinese are afraid of common pets. I think it’s very funny, but some are really scared of animals, even very tiny and harmless ones. This may be because of something in their childhood, I don’t know. There are many people in China who like pets, but not the majority, for sure.
### What kinds of pets are most popular in China? 
Dogs and cats arc by far the most common. I think the single most common pet is either the Pekingese dog or the Pug dog. I think they are both quite ugly, but sometimes they’re so ugly they’re cute. A lot of people also keep guard dogs to protect their property.
### What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of having a pet? 
A pet can be a good friend: sometimes the best friend. Pets are also great playmates for children. 1 think it’s very good for kids to have a pet when growing up. The disadvantages are that pets arc expensive to feed and care for, and require a lot of time, depending on the kind of pet.
### Do you think there should be laws to protect the welfare of pets and farm animals? 
I don’t really know. I guess there should be laws, but we really shouldn’t need them. People should be responsible enough to treat pets and farm animals well. But since many people are too selfish to care, we must have some laws. But the laws shouldn’t become so important that they nearly equal laws protecting the welfare of human beings.
