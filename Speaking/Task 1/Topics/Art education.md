## Questions
* Do schools in China have art classes? 
  > No, not really. Sometimes they do, but most of the time if the students or their parents want children to study art, they must go to special art classes. Or the schools do have art classes, but they aren’t part of the curriculum, and parents must pay extra to have their children attend these classes. More often than not, children in China don’t take art classes, and few children ever develop an interest in it.
* Should arts education be part of the school curriculum? 
  > Yes, it should. I think art is a very important subject, because it not only encourages self- expression, but also is a creative art and helps to develop artistic creativity’ in many areas of life, not just art. Also, children who feel they are accomplished and are able to do something more than study do better in other classes and subjects, because they have a higher self-esteem. Children who don’t know how to do anything other than their basic subjects will feel inferior to their peers, and will not perform as well in class as they could.
* How do you think art classes affect child development? 
  > They help to develop a child’s creativity and curiosity. They help a child to express himself through the things he draws, notice the things around him and learn from them. Art also encourages an admiration for nature and living tilings, so children who have been taught to appreciate art are less likely to do things that are harmful to the environment, to others, or to themselves.
* What kind of paintings do Chinese people like? 
  > Hmmm, that’s a little hard to answer. I think that Chinese paintings arc very popular in China. Most people here in China like paintings in the Chinese style or paintings of familiar scenes here. There are also quite a few abstract and realistic paintings and styles that are popular with certain groups of people.
* Some paintings are very expensive, but people still want to buy them. Why do you think they do so? 
  > I think that most of the time they want to have a very expensive painting so that they can show it off to their friends. Or maybe they feel it makes them look more in style or more fashionable to have expensive paintings by famous people. Some people collect paintings or works of art, so they will get anything they think will look nice with their collections.
* What benefits can you get from painting as a hobby? 
  > I think there are many benefits. For one, it can he very relaxing to paint, especially if you are outside in nature. Also it can help to take your mind off of any problem or stress that you might have from your work. It will also improve your creativity and help you to think better.
