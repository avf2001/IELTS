## Questions
### How often do you buy others gifts? 
Since I’m one of those idealists when it comes to buying presents, not often do I buy others gifts, but it doesn’t have to be a special occasion that I send them presents. Especially to my friends, just a small gift like a handmade bracelet or a simple drawing could make their day.
### What kinds of gifts are popular in your country? 
I think gifts are becoming more diverse these days. Stuffed animals, accessories, jewelries and flowers are too traditional for the young. Probably handmade stuff is currently on top of the list because of their spiritual value. And sometimes it doesn’t have to be a physical gift. Probably a delicious homemade meal is enough to make their day.
### Are expensive gifts always better than cheap gifts? 
No, definitely not. A gift doesn’t have to be expensive in order to show care for the person receiving it. Often a very expensive gift can show that they were just buying something but not really thinking about what would mean the most to the receiver. This isn’t always the case, but 1 think that a cheap gilt can mean just as much or even more than an expensive gilt can.
### Do you think it is necessary for friends to give presents to each other? 
No, it’s not necessary. It’s nice when friends give each other gifts, but there are other things you can do to show your friend your care. If someone is your friend, you shouldn’t expect that they will always get you gifts. True friendship is caring about the other, not looking for how much he can give you.
