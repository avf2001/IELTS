### Do you have many friends? [Why/Why not?]
I have more than 10 friends and I am not sure if I should say this is many! However, I had more than 30 friends in my school days. With the passage of the time, the number plummeted. If I count my Facebook friends as real friends, the number would go high!
### How often do you go out with friends? [Why/Why not?]
I meet my friends almost twice a week. I love to spend my weekends with them and sometimes I visit different places, watch movies and discuss different topics with them. I do not go out with all of my friends. I mostly hang out with 2-3 close buddies and go out with them almost 3-4 times a month.
### Tell me about your best friend at school.
My best friend in school was John and he was a great friend. He was tall and brave. He taught me how to show courage when we are in trouble. He has a great impact on my life. Though he lives in Australia now, we regularly communicate via Skype. I specifically liked him because he was more like a brother than a friend to me.
### How friendly are you with your neighbours? [Why/Why not?]
I must say I am quite lucky to have good neighbours who are always supportive and well-behaved. I am quite close to them. We have been living in our neighbourhood for more than a decade and our neighbours have become our close relatives. We have a mutual understanding and an invisible bond that ties us together as good neighbours. I respect their opinion, privacy and try to step forward whenever they need me.
### Which is more important to you, friends or family? [Why?]
To be honest, family comes first. However, there are some friends who become our family members. The bond between family members is often stronger but this does not mean that we do not have friends who are less important in our life. Being with the family makes us who we really are and friends make our life worth living.
### How often do you like to hang out with friends? 
I hang out with my friends from time to time. Normally if we have lots of time on the weekends, we will go to the cinema to watch movies to have a good time. We might also have dinner together in a restaurant if we have the time.
### Who do you usually like to hang out with? 
Usually I like to hang out with one of my close friends. Actually we live in the same community so we can meet frequently. Also, both of our kids are in the same class in kindergarten, so we like to take them to the park or playground together.
### Where do you like to go when you hang out with your friends? 
Well, that depends. We sometimes go to a restaurant to enjoy tasty food if someone knows a decent place. Also if we have plenty of time we like to plan a hike or camp in a nearby forest park to enjoy outdoor life. That would be a very memorable experience.
### Do you like to go out with a big group or just few friends? 
Well, if I had to choose between the two, I would probably go with hanging out with a big group people because I think that I am an extrovert. I like to meet different people to know about different kinds of life and make myself more sociable : whereas, you know, with only a few people around, it would be hard to find something interesting to do, such as travelling, hiking, etc.
