# Family and Friends
## Questions
* Do you spend much time with your family?
* Who are you closest to in your family?
* Do you prefer spending time with your family or friends?
* Who is your best friend?
* Are you still friends with people from your childhood?
* Is family important in your country?
* Do you have many friends? [Why/Why not?]
    > I have more than 10 friends and I am not sure if I should say this is many! However, I had more than 30 friends in my school days. With the passage of the time, the number plummeted. If I count my Facebook friends as real friends, the number would go high!
* How often do you go out with friends? [Why/Why not?]
    > I meet my friends almost twice a week. I love to spend my weekends with them and sometimes I visit different places, watch movies and discuss different topics with them. I do not go out with all of my friends. I mostly hang out with 2-3 close buddies and go out with them almost 3-4 times a month.
* Tell me about your best friend at school.
    > My best friend in school was John and he was a great friend. He was tall and brave. He taught me how to show courage when we are in trouble. He has a great impact on my life. Though he lives in Australia now, we regularly communicate via Skype. I specifically liked him because he was more like a brother than a friend to me.
* How friendly are you with your neighbours? [Why/Why not?]
    > I must say I am quite lucky to have good neighbours who are always supportive and well-behaved. I am quite close to them. We have been living in our neighbourhood for more than a decade and our neighbours have become our close relatives. We have a mutual understanding and an invisible bond that ties us together as good neighbours. I respect their opinion, privacy and try to step forward whenever they need me.
* Which is more important to you, friends or family? [Why?]
    > To be honest, family comes first. However, there are some friends who become our family members. The bond between family members is often stronger but this does not mean that we do not have friends who are less important in our life. Being with the family makes us who we really are and friends make our life worth living.
