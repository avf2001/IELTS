## Questions
### Do you prefer to watch sports events on TV at home or to watch them live? (Why?) 
I prefer watching sports on TV, because sometimes you’re watching a game that looks like it’ll be loads of fun but it turns out to be super boring where your team gels creamed and you feel like crying. If you are at the stadium watching the game there’s nothing you can do but cry, but it you are at home you can just change the channel to something fun. Watching sports at home is also more economical, you can be watching 3 or 4 games for just a few more an hour.
### What are the advantages and disadvantages of going to see a live sports event, such as a football match, compared to watching the event at home on TV? 
Like I said before, if von go to a sports event you have to stay and watch the whole thing, whereas if you stay at home you can change the channel or turn off the TV. Also you can see the game close up whereas if you’re in the stadium then you’ll see a faraway view of the game. One advantage of going to a sports event is that you can experience the excitement of the game. The game is so much more alive and real than if you were just watching it. You feel like if you yell louder then your team might actually have a greater chance of winning. Also if someone decides to streak at halftime then you won’t have to worry about the sports channel switching to the anchors who talk about the game.
### Does the ticket price to live sporting events affect decisions to attend? 
Yes I think the price is an extremely big deciding factor. Take the World Master’s Cup inShanghai, for instance. If the admission fee was only 100 RMB, more than half of Shanghainese could’ve attended the game.
### What about the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing — what do you think would be a reasonable price for admission tickets? 
I’m not really sure, I haven’t thought about it that much, but I’d prefer if they were free so then maybe I’d be able to go. My best guess is that they will probably go for at least a few hundred yuan a ticket. People from all over the World and China will be coming to Beijing and they will have money, so I don’t think price will be a huge problem.
