## Questions
### Which do you think is a better attitude for children to have: a strong spirit of competition or a strong spirit of cooperation with others? 
Both. One can be competent but if they cannot cooperate with others, they will meet with failure in their life. No matter where you go, what position you hold in a company, you will have to work with others, communicate and cooperate with them. If all you are capable of is competition, how can anyone else benefit you? Whatever those children choose to do, they will desperately need both skills.
### Do you think that too much competition could damage the spirit of cooperation in society? 
Of course. By that I mean that competition can eventually lead to war, as has happened on a number of occasions in Central America. If you promote competition so much in comparison to fair play and good sportsmanship then the wrong values are being espoused. Cooperation is based on working together to help the whole. When you foster this spirit then you are contributing to society. 11.Some people say that success means being number one and that being number two is valueless. What do you think? This is really an immature way to look at life. I really believe that you just have to get up and keep trying no matter who is in first or even second place. Just finishing the race has its rewards. Forget about what others are doing and just get on with life, this is my philosophy, which I try to live by.
