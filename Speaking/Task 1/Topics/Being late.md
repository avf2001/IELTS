## Questions
* What are some of the excuses that people make when they are late? 
  > Well, “The alarm didn’t go on and the bus was late or I was caught in traffic.” Those arc just a few of the most-heard excuses. “My mom is sick, and I have to take care of her.” is another. “I have to take my brother to school ” will work sometimes. “I got caught in the rain.” helps in the spring time.
* Are people in China usually punctual when they have to be somewhere at a certain time? 
  > Well, I wouldn’t say that they are there on time every time, but they are getting there, they are starting to have the same attitude with people in the West that “time is money ”. It really is a bit of a hard habit to break, as the style of life and the culture have not been that of arriving right on the dot. Of course if people really want to be punctual, and it is really important to them, then they will do everything they can to get there on time.
* What do people in China think of people who are late? 
  > Actually Chinese people arc pretty generous overall with people who arc late. They arc understanding and don’t make a big deal out of it. On the other hand, if they arc really bothered by people being late, you wouldn’t know about it anyway, as most Chinese people don’t reveal their feelings very easily. Overall they are pretty easygoing on people who are late.
* Do you think it’s important to be on time? (Is punctuality important?) 
  > Yes, I think it is very important to be on time. If you are not on time, then you are basically robbing the time of others. It really shows a lack of respect for others and that you don’t think their time is important.
* For what situations is being on time important? 
  > Immediately the first thing that comes to my mind is your own wedding. If any event is important I would say that is, getting to your wedding. There is a funny saying in the West. It goes something like this, “He would be late to his own funeral!” I suppose that is a little extreme but funny, though no one has ever been late for that. A job interview would be an important time not to be late. If you want to make a good impression, and they say “first impressions arc the greatest ones,’’ then you should try to be there early.
* For what situations is being on time not very important? 
  > If you were going to go and meet your friends for a game of basketball, and you knew they were going to be there for the afternoon, then you would not have to get there on the dot but would have a little leeway on arriving. If you were supposed to be home for dinner, but you came in a little late, that would be understandable. If you were going to your parents for the day, and you came a little late, they would understand. Most situations in which being late isn’t too important would involve friends and family.
