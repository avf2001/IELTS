## Questions
### What kinds of jobs have higher pay? Why? 
Jobs like designing and repairing computer software, lawyers, doctors and surgeons, building designers, scientists, and Hollywood actors arc some better paying jobs. All these jobs require years of study, research, and lots of experience in that field.
### What occupations do you think will get high salary in the future? 
People who are multilingual will be highly sought after in the future. As the world is becoming more international, people who speak more than 2 languages fluently will be greatly needed. English is the main international language right now. but there are billions of extremely intellectual individuals who can’t speak or understand English. These people don’t want to get left out of all the fun and games that are happening in the rest of the world, so they need translators who will be able to make them understood by people of different races.
### Is pay the most important factor in your job? 
The most important factor is, as most fun loving people know, how much vacation time you get : not only time get, but paid time off. Another important thing to keep in mind is what kind of work it is. Some work is just boring and nobody likes doing it—except for boring people. But if you really want to excel in your work, pick something that you feel comfortable doing, something that you’re good at. The workplace environment is also very important. Some offices are stuffy and drab. whereas others make you feel fresh and alive.
### What is the primary source of income for the Chinese government?
The primary source of government income is taxes. Taxes are the way that governments support all their projects around the country. Whether they’re building skyscrapers, roads, or schools in impoverished counties, all this funding comes from taxes. Another way to put it is that you’re supporting the government, because you’re the one paying the taxes. Whenever you see government officials on the news doing something or another, you can know that you are actually responsible, since it is you who made it possible for them to do it.
### Do you think the government should let people know how it spends money?
You know, that would be very nice. I’ve always wondered what exactly is going on behind those closed doors. Naturally some things just can’t be talked about because they’re state secrets, and some things you probably don’t want to know about, such as how- much money was spent on this banquet, or that convention, or how many liters of gasoline their vehicles consume each month. But I would like to know’ exactly what they’re spending my money on.
