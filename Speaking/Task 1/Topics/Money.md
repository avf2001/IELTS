## Questions
### What kinds of jobs have higher pay? Why? 
Jobs like designing and repairing computer software, lawyers, doctors and surgeons, building designers, scientists, and Hollywood actors arc some better paying jobs. All these jobs require years of study, research, and lots of experience in that field.
### What occupations do you think will get high salary in the future? 
People who are multilingual will be highly sought after in the future. As the world is becoming more international, people who speak more than 2 languages fluently will be greatly needed. English is the main international language right now. but there are billions of extremely intellectual individuals who can’t speak or understand English. These people don’t want to get left out of all the fun and games that are happening in the rest of the world, so they need translators who will be able to make them understood by people of different races.
### Is pay the most important factor in your job? 
The most important factor is, as most fun loving people know, how much vacation time you get : not only time get, but paid time off. Another important thing to keep in mind is what kind of work it is. Some work is just boring and nobody likes doing it—except for boring people. But if you really want to excel in your work, pick something that you feel comfortable doing, something that you’re good at. The workplace environment is also very important. Some offices are stuffy and drab. whereas others make you feel fresh and alive.
### What is the primary source of income for the Chinese government?
The primary source of government income is taxes. Taxes are the way that governments support all their projects around the country. Whether they’re building skyscrapers, roads, or schools in impoverished counties, all this funding comes from taxes. Another way to put it is that you’re supporting the government, because you’re the one paying the taxes. Whenever you see government officials on the news doing something or another, you can know that you are actually responsible, since it is you who made it possible for them to do it.
### Do you think the government should let people know how it spends money?
You know, that would be very nice. I’ve always wondered what exactly is going on behind those closed doors. Naturally some things just can’t be talked about because they’re state secrets, and some things you probably don’t want to know about, such as how- much money was spent on this banquet, or that convention, or how many liters of gasoline their vehicles consume each month. But I would like to know’ exactly what they’re spending my money on.
### How much money is enough? 
Well, it’s hard to answer this question as there is no exact measurement to say whether money is enough or not. It’s up to (1) perspective and goal of different people. Some people want to earn more money so they can save up but some just need a certain amount of money to (2)sustain their lives.
### Why do people care too much about money? 
I think the reason is simply because money equals power. The more money you have ,the more things you can do ,the more influence you have over people. No one refuses power so that’s why they give priority to money
### Is money important to you? 
Absolutely. I can buy things with money and give presents for my family by my own money. It makes my life more meaningful . It’s like a motivation to (1) push me forward and work harder to enhance my life. For me, money is just never enough and if I’m satisfied with what I earn, I’ll (2) fall behind with fellows
### What do people in your country save money for? 
I suppose it’s up to different purposes. While the young save money for travelling or paying tuition fees, the elderly tend to keep money for health service and their kids. However, young people have more (1) desire than (2) the seniors so they often spend more than their (3)savings.
### Do you think children are given too much pocket money in China? 
It really depends on how much they’re getting. Some kids definitely get way more than they need, and others don’t get enough. There are some families where the parents hardly have enough money to pay their bills and get food : I don’t think these families should feel obliged to give their children money that they don’t have. But if they do have money, then it would be nice to give at least some spending money to their children.
### How do you think parents could teach the value of money to their children?
If you give your children only a small amount of money each week then they’ll have to learn to make it last. It might take a while for them to learn, and they might be broke for the first few months, but after a while they’ll realize that money doesn’t grow on trees and will respect its value. Of course there are children who always want everything they see, and if the parents give it to them then the kids won’t value money at all.
### Do you think it is important to let children learn money skills?
I think that’s a wonderful idea. If all kids knew how to do banking, open a savings account and cash checks, their parents would have a lot more leisure time. And even if the parents still do the banking, at least when their kids grow up they won’t be totally helpless. In fact, they’ll have a big jump on the other kids their age.
### Do you think people should he paid extra when they work overtime?
If you pay someone extra to work overtime then you’re, in a sense, giving them an incentive to work harder. When the work day is over, most people just want to go home and relax. Some people are workaholics and don’t think anything of working until 3 or 4 in the morning and getting up at 6 a few hours later to go back to work. But these people are rare. So if you want more people to work later an overtime bonus is a very good idea.
