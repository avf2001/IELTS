## Questions
### What kinds of food do Chinese people like to eat? 
Many Chinese like to eat their vegetables cooked. They enjoy eating food that is fried, steamed, and sometimes boiled, but rarely eat baked food. The only time they will eat bake food is when they have cakes from the store. Most Chinese food is cut in bite-sized pieces before being cooked and served.
### How important is eating a healthy diet? 
I think eating healthy is a very important part of life. If you don’t give your body what it needs then it won’t be able to function well. This is why what you eat is so important to how well you are able to do things. Eating well even improves study.
### Are there many vegetarians in China? 
I believe there are a fair amount of vegetarians. Most Chinese already eat very little meat, so without even trying they are almost vegetarians. However, I think if they had the chance, many Chinese would eat more meat than they do now. Though as health awareness increases I believe there will be a rise in the number of vegetarians in China.
### Is the food that people eat today in China different to the food that people used to eat in the past? 
I think that in many ways it is quite the same. I do know that in recent years there has been a rise in the number of fast-food restaurant. Many people especially of the younger generation, enjoy going to these restaurants. The actual Chinese food, though, has not seen much change over the years.
### How do you think the way we cut will change in the future? 
Our eating habits will of course affect the way we will live in the future because of the effect it has on our health. If we eat well then we will have better health as we get older. I believe, though, that as time goes by fast food will become more popular. We will be entering a time in history where going fast will mean the difference between success and failure, so the food industry will change to accommodate the population’s demand.
### Is fast food popular in China? 
Yes, fast food is very popular here in China. I believe the main reason the taste is very different from that of Chinese food. This appeals to the youth of China. Also the advertisements of most fast food restaurants portray their food as cool or western food.
